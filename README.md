SL4A (android) python script to check remaining minutes on Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk plans

## requirements ##

the [SL4A](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/) App, and an installed [Python interpreter](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/InstallingInterpreters). 

## installation ##

The easiest way to get it on your phone right now is to create a QRCode and scan it in. `mk.sh` does this. On *nix (requires `feh` and `qrencode` installed) run `mk.sh`, and that will generate and show a QRCode version of the script. [Instructions for getting it on your phone](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/SharingScripts).

To transfer the file directly, check `cp.sh` for my quick hack.

## coming soon ##

an apk builder, so it can be installed standalone.

## license ##
